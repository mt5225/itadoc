The API is a RESTful web service; that is, it conforms to the architectural principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). Its RESTful architecture features a straightforward, easy-to-use interface facilitated by standard HTTP request and response messages that carry :ref:`JSON format <json-label>` payloads.
